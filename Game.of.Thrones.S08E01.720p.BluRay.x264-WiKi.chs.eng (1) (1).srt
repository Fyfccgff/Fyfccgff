权力的游戏

00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,540
权力的游戏

7
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:52,740
权力的游戏

8
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,840
权力的游戏

9
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,020
你该庆幸自己走运
You should consider yourself lucky.

10
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,130
至少不会冻掉蛋蛋
At least your balls won't freeze off.

11
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,900
你恨别人讲关于侏儒的笑话
You take great offense at dwarf jokes,

12
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,240
却老拿太监开玩笑  是何道理
but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?

13
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,110
因为我有卵蛋  你没有
Because I have balls, and you don't.

14
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,840
我警告过你
I warned you.

15
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,920
北境人不大信得过外人
Northerners don't much trust outsiders.

16
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,810
看看你
Look at you.

17
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,570
都长大成人了
You're a man.

18
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,740
不完全是
Almost.

19
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,110
-艾莉亚呢  -不知道躲在哪儿
- Where's Arya? - Lurking somewhere.

20
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,400
这是坦格利安家族的丹妮莉丝女王
Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.

21
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,770
这是我妹妹  珊莎·史塔克  临冬城城主
My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell.

22
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,320
谢谢你请我们到你家来  史塔克小姐
Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark.

23
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,680
北境正如你哥哥说的那般美丽
The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed,

24
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,840
你也是
as are you.

25
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,240
临冬城是您的了  陛下
Winterfell is yours, Your Grace.

26
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,870
我们没时间客套了
We don't have time for all this.

27
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,500
夜王抓了你的一条龙  它也变成了异类
The Night King has your dragon. He's one of them now.

28
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,940
长城已坍塌
The Wall has fallen,

29
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,870
死人军团正在南下
the dead march south.

30
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,610
我们一接到长城被突破的消息
As soon as we heard about the Wall,

31
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,760
我就下令所有封臣退守临冬城
I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell.

32
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,000
安柏大人
Lord Umber...

33
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,730
你的人什么时候到
when can we expect your people to arrive?

34
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,080
我们需要更多车马  请小姐允准
We need more horses and wagons, if it please my lady.

35
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,480
大人
And my lord.

36
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,490
女王陛下  失礼了
And my queen. Sorry.

37
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,500
我们会尽量腾出车马支援
You'll have as many as we can spare.

38
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,390
快回最后壁炉城  把你的人带过来
Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.

39
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,900
我们还得送信给守夜人
We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well.

40
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,300
没必要再驻守城堡了
There's no sense in manning the castles anymore.

41
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,570
我们就在这里御敌
We make our stand here.

42
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,260
马上就办  陛下
At once, Your Grace.

43
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,150
"陛下"
"Your Grace."

44
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,330
但你已经不是了  对吧
But you're not. Are you?

45
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,790
你离开临冬城时是国王  但回来时
You left Winterfell a king and came back a--

46
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,090
我也不知道你现在算什么
I'm not sure what you are now.

47
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,280
领主
A lord?

48
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,630
或者什么都不是
Nothing at all?

49
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,900
-这不重要  -不重要
- It's not important. - Not important?

50
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,470
我们拥立你为北境之王
We named you King in the North.

51
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,770
北境之王
King of the North!

52
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,310
是的  小姐
You did, my lady.

53
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,350
那是我莫大的荣幸
It was the honor of my life.

54
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,130
我永远感激你们的信任
I'll always be grateful for your faith.

55
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,790
但我离开临冬城时
But when I left Winterfell,

56
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,710
就说过我们需要盟友  否则必死无疑
I told you we need allies or we will die.

57
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,750
我把盟友带了回来
I have brought those allies home

58
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,560
与我们一同作战
to fight alongside us.

59
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,140
我需要做出选择
I had a choice,

60
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,080
是保住王位  还是保护北境
keep my crown or protect the North.

61
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,600
我选择了北境
I chose the North.

62
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,320
如果这场战争中有谁能活下来
If anyone survives the war to come,

63
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,340
就要感谢琼恩·雪诺
we'll have Jon Snow to thank.

64
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,450
他冒着生命危险证明了威胁真实存在
He risked his life to show us the threat is real.

65
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,970
因为他的勇气
Thanks to his courage,

66
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,730
我们带来了一支
we have brought with us the greatest army

67
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,050
前所未有的大军
the world has ever seen.

68
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,600
我们带来了两头成年巨龙
We have brought two full-grown dragons.

69
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,980
很快  兰尼斯特大军
And soon, the Lannister army

70
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,910
也将北上与我们共同抗敌
will ride north to join our cause.

71
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,440
我知道  我们双方
I know, I know, our people

72
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,990
过去称不上友好
haven't been friends in the past.

73
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,010
但现在  我们必须并肩作战
But we must fight together now...

74
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,870
否则唯有一死
or die.

75
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,890
冒昧地问一句  我们要怎样养活
May I ask, how are we meant to feed

76
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,410
这支有史以来最庞大的军队
the greatest army the world has ever seen?

77
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,460
我分配物资以求挨过寒冬之时
While I ensured our stores would last through winter,

78
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,440
可没算上多斯拉克人
I didn't account for Dothraki,

79
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,890
无垢者和两头成年巨龙
Unsullied and two full-grown dragons.

80
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,610
而且  龙到底吃什么呢
What do dragons eat, anyway?

81
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,940
它们想吃什么就吃什么
Whatever they want.

82
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:19,460
当心了小伙子们  我们一块也浪费不起
Hey, careful, lads. We need every last bit of it.

83
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,550
抱歉
Sorry 'bout that.

84
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,810
最后几车都在这了
Are these the last of the wagons?

85
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,730
对
Aye.

86
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,460
好  都送到熔炉那去
All right, let's get it all to the forges.

87
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,660
大人
My lord.

88
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:42,740
夫人
My lady.

89
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,500
告退
My lady.

90
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,300
临冬城城主
The Lady of Winterfell.

91
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,330
蛮动听的
Has a nice ring to it.

92
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,450
女王之手也不差
So does Hand of the Queen.

93
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,200
我猜取决于谁来当女王
Depending on the queen, I suppose.

94
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,180
我们上次对话还是在乔佛里的婚礼上
Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding.

95
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,840
-可怕的事件  -轰动一时
- Miserable affair. - It had its moments.

96
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,580
我为不辞而别道歉
Apologies for leaving like that.

97
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,390
是啊  我的爱妻在国王殒命当刻失踪
Yes, it was a bit hard to explain

98
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,820
的确难以解释
why my wife fled moments after the king's murder.

99
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,010
我们都没有死掉
We both survived.

100
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,410
低估过你的人很多
Many underestimated you.

101
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,370
如今大半都死了
Most of them are dead now.

102
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,110
得知兰尼斯特大军北上
I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear

103
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,060
想必你不会太高兴
the Lannister army's marching north.

104
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,710
你惧怕我老姐是有道理的
You have every right to be fearful of my sister.

105
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,140
没人比我更怕她
No one fears her more than I do.

106
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,440
-但我保证  你不会有事  -瑟曦告诉你
- But I promise, you'll be safe-- - Cersei told you her army

107
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,410
她派军队北上是为你们而战
was coming north to fight for you?

108
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:11,450
没错
She did.

109
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,410
而你相信她
And you believed her?

110
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,740
现在的她有活下去的理由
She has something to live for now.

111
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,460
我相信她有求生的欲望
I believe she wants to survive.

112
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,930
我曾经以为你是世上最聪明的人
I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.

113
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,050
你变矮了
You used to be taller.

114
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,810
你怎么走路没声音
How did you sneak up on me?

115
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,870
你怎么心口挨了刀还没死
How did you survive a knife through the heart?

116
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,270
我死了
I didn't.

117
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,610
你还带着
You still have it.

118
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,720
缝衣针
Needle.

119
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,490
用过吗
Have you ever used it?

120
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,040
一两次
Once or twice.

121
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,280
瓦雷利亚钢
Valyrian steel.

122
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,350
嫉妒了
Jealous?

123
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,020
太重  不适合我
Too heavy for me.

124
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,150
你先前跑去哪了
Where were you before?

125
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,350
不帮我在珊莎面前说句话
I could've used your help with Sansa.

126
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,720
她不喜欢你的女王 是吗
She doesn't like your queen, does she?

127
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,600
珊莎自以为比所有人都聪明
Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.

128
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,060
她是我见过的最聪明的人
She's the smartest person I've ever met.

129
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,680
你开始替她说话了
Now you're defending her?

130
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,280
你
You?

131
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,880
我在守护我们的家族
I'm defending our family.

132
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,560
她也是
So is she.

133
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,190
没错
Yeah.

134
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,310
我也是她的家人
I'm her family too.

135
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,600
别忘记了
Don't forget that.

136
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,190
陛下  恐怕我要告诉您一个坏消息
Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring terrible news.

137
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,900
死人军团已经突破了长城
The dead have broken through the Wall.

138
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,250
很好
Good.

139
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,730
何不直接给我个痛快
Why don't you just get it over with and kill me?

140
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,620
我们可是家人啊
But we're family.

141
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,560
世上最后的葛雷乔伊
The last Greyjoys left in the world.

142
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,050
至少是最后两个有种的
The last ones with balls anyway.

143
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,120
要是杀了你
If I kill you...

144
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,900
我跟谁说话去
who can I talk to?

145
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,080
船员都是哑巴
I've got a crew full of mutes.

146
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,060
在海上很寂寞啊
It gets lonely at sea.

147
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,250
我们到君临了吗
Are we in King's Landing?

148
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,230
你站在了必败的一方
You picked the losing side.

149
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,910
那我就带铁舰队换个去处
Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet somewhere else.

150
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,010
但首先  我要上了女王
But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.

151
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,300
两万人  是吗
Twenty-thousand men, is it?

152
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,530
是的  陛下  途中有几人丧生
Yes, Your Grace. A few died in transit.

153
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,230
他们玩骰子出千
They cheated at dice.

154
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,540
也可能是我出千
Or maybe I cheated.

155
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,350
反正有人出千
Someone cheated.

156
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,810
那几个不是什么好战士  对您没损失
They weren't good fighters. You won't miss them.

157
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,890
-马匹呢  -两千匹
- Horses? - Two thousand.

158
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,430
大象呢
And elephants?

159
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,810
没有大象  陛下
Uh, no elephants, Your Grace.

160
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,570
真让人失望
That's disappointing.

161
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,200
我听说黄金团是有大象的
I was told the Golden Company had elephants.

162
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,660
大象是极好的畜牲  陛下
They are excellent beasts, Your Grace,

163
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,820
但不适合漂洋过海
but not well-suited to long sea voyages.

164
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,780
无论如何  你都是
In any event, you are most welcome

165
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:49,020
君临的座上宾  斯崔克兰团长
here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland.

166
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,350
我们期待为您而战  陛下
We look forward to fighting on your behalf, Your Grace.

167
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,970
我也是座上宾吗
Am I most welcome here?

168
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,550
你是王室的挚友
You are a true friend of the crown

169
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,950
和贵宾
and an honored guest.

170
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:11,720
很好
Good.

171
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,570
作为挚友和贵宾
As a true friend and an honored guest...

172
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,550
我希望我们能私下谈谈
I was hoping we could talk in private.

173
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,980
战争结束后  我们说好的
After the war. That was our agreement.

174
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,730
战争有时会持续数年
Wars sometimes last years.

175
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,730
你想要个婊子  花钱去买
You want a whore, buy one.

176
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,390
想得到女王
You want a queen...

177
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:43,820
就要去争取
earn her.

178
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,050
还要怎样
How?

179
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:50,920
我替她讨还了公道
I've given her justice,

180
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,640
带来一支军队  还有铁舰队
an army and the Iron Fleet,

181
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,750
可她对我爱答不理
yet she gives me no sign of affection.

182
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,980
我的心都快碎了
My heart is nearly broken.

183
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,560
你太无礼了
You're insolent.

184
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,590
我为更微不足道的冒犯处死过人
I've executed men for less.

185
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,140
因为那些人微不足道
They were lesser men.

186
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,560
听说龙烧死了一千兰尼斯特士兵
I hear the dragon burnt up a thousand Lannister men.

187
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,380
烧死了几个我最喜欢的小伙子
Burnt up some of my favorite boys.

188
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,200
-阿奇  是叫这个吧  -还有威廉
- Archie, was it? - And William.

189
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,670
-高大帅气的威廉  -没错  高大帅气的威廉
- Tall handsome William? - Yeah, tall handsome William.

190
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,910
他们说他的残骸一只酒杯就盛得下
They said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass.

191
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,230
我是你们见过的男人里  唯一射中过龙的
I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.

192
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,430
-是吗  -差点干掉它
- Did you? - Nearly killed it.

193
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,630
好勇敢
That's brave.

194
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,370
-那个叫埃迪的小子  -那个红毛吗
- That boy Eddie... - The ginger?

195
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,520
就是他  回来时脸都烧掉了
That's him. Came back with his face burnt right off.

196
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,110
他现在没有眼皮了
He's got no eyelids now.

197
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,580
没有眼皮他怎么睡觉呢
How does he sleep with no eyelids?

198
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,890
好了  我们能不讨论该死的龙了吗
All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?

199
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,610
黑水的波隆爵士
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

200
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,440
开什么玩笑
You're kidding me.

201
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,790
抱歉扰您雅兴
Apologies for the interruption,

202
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,630
但女王命我不得延误
but the queen did urge me to hurry.

203
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,830
对不住了  小姐们
Sorry, ladies.

204
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,480
改日吧
Another time perhaps.

205
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,610
您要是寂寞了  记得我偏好年长的先生
You ever get lonely, I am partial to older gentlemen.

206
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:03,370
可怜的姑娘  梅毒年内就会要了她的命
Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.

207
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,120
哪一个
Which girl?

208
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,030
女王的弟弟们对你的承诺未能兑现
The queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them.

209
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,080
女王陛下希望纠正他们的错误
Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.

210
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,160
她曾给我一座城堡  一个妻子
She once gave me a castle and a wife,

211
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,970
转身就"纠正"掉了
then rectified me right out of them.

212
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,860
那是詹姆爵士所为  不是她
That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers.

213
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,120
瑟曦女王有求于人时
When Queen Cersei wants something,

214
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,140
必是先付酬劳  而且付的是黄金
she pays in advance and in gold.

215
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,800
准确的说是数箱黄金
Several chests of it, in fact.

216
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,910
就在门外的马车上等着你
Waiting for you in a wagon just outside.

217
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,900
所以她想取某人性命  又不能直接派兵
So she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers.

218
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,790
如果她的目标是龙女王...
If it's the Dragon Queen she's after...

219
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,100
关于坦格利安女孩  女王另有计划
She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.

220
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,160
那就祝她好运了
Yeah, well, good luck with that.

221
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,990
我们女王的弟弟们
Our queen's brothers are unlikely

222
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,460
此次北上  不大可能生还
to survive their Northern adventures.

223
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:52,050
但万一他们没死...
But in the event that they do...

224
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,990
女王对罪有应得所思甚深
She has a keen sense of poetic justice.

225
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,840
真是一家疯子
That fucking family.

226
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,800
被逐出学城时
When the Citadel expelled me,

227
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,050
我以为自己会在贫困和孤独中死去
I thought I would die poor and alone,

228
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,090
但瑟曦女王以首相之位回报我的辅佐
but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand.

229
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,900
若有人替她除掉背叛的弟弟们
What would she do for the man

230
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,210
女王会有何奖赏呢
who rids her of her treasonous brothers?

231
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,800
我想要那些战象
I wanted those elephants.

232
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,730
那么
So...

233
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:48,710
我跟胖子国王比起来怎样
how do I compare to the fat king?

234
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,440
你在侮辱亡夫
You're insulting my late husband?

235
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,900
冒犯到你了吗
Are you offended?

236
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,550
劳勃每晚换一个妓女
Robert had a different whore every night,

237
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,830
可他连鱼水之欢的门道都没摸到过
but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body.

238
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,470
弑君者呢
And the Kingslayer?

239
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,140
你很喜欢生死一线的感觉  是吗
You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?

240
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,860
生活无趣得紧
Life is boring.

241
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,970
你不无趣  这一点我承认
You're not boring, I'll give you that.

242
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,850
我取悦了女王吗
Do I please the queen?

243
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,790
你可能是我见过的最傲慢的人
You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met.

244
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,900
我喜欢
I like that.

245
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,170
但现在我想一个人静静
But now I want to be alone.

246
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,840
我要在你肚子里播种一个王子
I'm going to put a prince in your belly.

247
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,560
攸伦带着全部手下和舰队在君临
Euron can't defend the Iron Islands,

248
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,020
就不可能防守铁群岛
not if he's in King's Landing with all his men and his ships.

249
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,970
我们可以夺回家园
We can take our home back.

250
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,210
丹妮莉丝去了北方
Daenerys went north.

251
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,610
要是他们守不住北境
Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat

252
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,110
总得有个能撤守的地方
if they can't hold the North.

253
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,570
死人去不了的地方
Somewhere the dead can't go.

254
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,930
你是我的女王  我听你差遣
You're my queen. I go where you command.

255
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,360
你想去临冬城
You want to go to Winterfell.

256
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,180
为史塔克家而战
To fight for the Starks.

257
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,120
去吧
Go.

258
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,640
逝者不死
What is dead may never die.

259
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,070
逝者不死
What is dead may never die.

260
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,140
但还是要杀了那些渣滓
But kill the bastards anyway.

261
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,040
欢迎回来  小姐
Welcome back, my lady.

262
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:58,790
请跟我来
If you'd follow me...

263
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,840
卡史塔克家
The Karstarks.

264
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,990
家徽不错
One of the better sigils.

265
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,780
至少比洋葱强
Beats an onion, anyway.

266
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,380
无法反驳
Can't argue with that.

267
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,200
不久前  史塔克家和卡史塔克家
Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks

268
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:13,330
还在战场上互相残杀
were slaughtering each other on the battlefield.

269
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,590
琼恩·雪诺让他们讲和
Jon Snow brought peace to the houses.

270
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,940
我们的女王心怀感激
And our queen is grateful.

271
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,080
她的感激当然好  但那不是我想说的
Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point.

272
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,960
北方人效忠的是琼恩·雪诺  不是她
The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her.

273
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,240
他们不了解她
They don't know her.

274
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,250
自由民不了解她
The Free Folk don't know her.

275
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,160
我到这里有一阵了  告诉你们
I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you,

276
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,900
他们跟山羊一样顽固
they're stubborn as goats.

277
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:35,330
想要得到他们的忠诚  只能去争取
You want their loyalty, you have to earn it.

278
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,930
看来你准备献上良策
I sense that you're leading to a proposal.

279
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:52,390
我建议联姻
A proposal is what I'm proposing.

280
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,820
万一我们真的能击败夜王
On the off chance that we survive the Night King,

281
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,970
或许七国狗屎一样的历史上
what if the Seven Kingdoms,

282
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,400
终于能出现一对像样的统治者
for once in their whole shit history,

283
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:04,000
女的公正  男的可敬
were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?

284
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,460
他们确实是一对佳偶
They do make a handsome couple.

285
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,500
你们高估了我们的影响力
You overestimate our influence.

286
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,530
琼恩和丹妮莉丝不会听孤老头子的话
Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.

287
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,690
我没那么老
I'm not that old.

288
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,170
没他老
Not as old as him.

289
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,300
我们的女王尊重岁月积淀的智慧
Our queen respects the wisdom of age.

290
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,590
那是当然
Of course she does.

291
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,610
尊重是年轻人与我们保持距离的方式
Respect is how the young keep us at a distance,

292
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,390
免得我们让他们想起那令人不快的真相
so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth.

293
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,410
什么真相
What is that?

294
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:33,980
事难久长
Nothing lasts.

295
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,640
你妹妹不喜欢我
Your sister doesn't like me.

296
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,230
她不了解你
She doesn't know you.

297
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,560
我不是宽慰你
If it makes you feel any better,

298
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,720
我们小时候  她也不喜欢我
she didn't like me either when we were growing up.

299
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,590
她不必成为我的朋友
She doesn't need to be my friend...

300
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,650
但我是她的女王
but I am her queen.

301
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,290
如果她不能尊重我
If she can't respect me...

302
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,460
今天收获怎样

303
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:23,380
只有十八只山羊和十一只绵羊

304
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:27,620
怎么了
What's the matter?

305
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:29,440
龙吃得太少
The dragons are barely eating.

306
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,670
它们怎么了
What's wrong with them?

307
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,570
它们不喜欢北方
They don't like the North.

308
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,710
上去啊
Go on.

309
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,800
我不知道怎么骑龙
I don't know how to ride a dragon.

310
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,020
没有人知道  骑过才知道
Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon.

311
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,170
要是它不想让我骑怎么办
What if he doesn't want me to?

312
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,040
那我感谢你这些天的陪伴  琼恩·雪诺
Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow.

313
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:47,160
我该抓着什么
What do I hold onto?

314
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:49,740
能抓什么就抓什么
Whatever you can.

315
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,830
你害我丧失了骑马的乐趣
You've completely ruined horses for me.

316
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,950
我们可以在这儿躲上一千年
We could stay a thousand years...

317
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,360
没人找得到我们
no one would find us.

318
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,330
那我们可都老得不行了
We'd be pretty old.

319
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,530
对一个南方姑娘来说这里太冷了
It's cold up here for a southern girl.

320
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,320
那就帮你的女王暖暖身子
So keep your queen warm.

321
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,300
别害怕
Don't be afraid.

322
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,610
很好
That's good.

323
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,710
-詹德利  -他在
- Gendry? - He's here.

324
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,590
用龙晶锻造这么大的兵刃可不容易
It isn't easy making a blade that big with dragonglass.

325
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,430
你是在夸自己厉害吧
You're saying you're good, is that it?

326
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,780
我只是说这种材料难以...
I'm just saying it's a tricky material to--

327
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,280
知道给野人打兵器的都是什么货色吗
You know who makes weapons for the wildlings?

328
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:21,990
残废和舔屌的
Cripples and cocksuckers.

329
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,470
-你是哪种  -离他远点
- Which one are you? - Leave him be.

330
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,030
听说你到了这里
I heard you were here.

331
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,500
你丢下我等死
You left me to die.

332
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,550
劫你的财物在先
First I robbed you.

333
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,870
你就是个冷血的小婊子  对吧
You're a cold little bitch, aren't you?

334
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,250
也许这正是你还活着的原因
Guess that's why you're still alive.

335
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,100
你为他打的斧头很不错
That was a nice ax you made for him.

336
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,080
你变厉害了
You've gotten better.

337
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,420
谢谢  你也是
Yeah, thanks. So have you.

338
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:18,140
我是说  你看上去还不赖
I mean, you look good.

339
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,660
谢谢  你也是
Thanks. So do you.

340
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,700
要不是太冷  在这地方长大也挺不错的
It's not a bad place to grow up, if it wasn't so cold.

341
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,420
那就靠炉子近点
Stay close to that forge, then.

342
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:35,060
-这是命令吗  史塔克小姐  -别这么叫我
- Is that a command, Lady Stark? - Don't call me that.

343
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,190
如你所愿  小姐
As you wish, milady.

344
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,530
我的所愿是这样的
Here's my wish.

345
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,200
造得出来吗
Can you make it?

346
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:51,000
你要这种东西做什么
What do you need something like this for?

347
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,890
你能不能造出来
Can you make it or not?

348
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,920
你已经有一把剑了  那是什么
You already have a sword. What's that?

349
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,560
瓦雷利亚钢
It's Valyrian steel.

350
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,760
我就知道你跟别的富家小姐没两样
I always knew you were just another rich girl.

351
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,550
你根本不认识别的富家小姐
You don't know any other rich girls.

352
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:21,860
请进
Come in.

353
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,700
葛洛佛大人祝我们好运
Lord Glover wishes us good fortune,

354
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:34,570
他和他的军队只会坐守深林堡
but he's staying in Deepwood Motte with his men.

355
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,570
"葛洛佛家族将站在史塔克家族身后
"House Glover will stand behind House Stark

356
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,690
一千年来一如既往"
as we have for a thousand years."

357
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:44,620
他是不是这么说的
Isn't that what he said?

358
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,250
他说的是  "我将站在北境之王
"I will stand behind Jon Snow," He said.

359
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,590
琼恩·雪诺的身后"
"The King in the North."

360
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,590
我说过我们需要盟友
I told you we needed allies.

361
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,380
你没说你要放弃北境之王的头衔
You didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown.

362
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,390
我从未想过称王
I never wanted a crown.

363
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,280
我只想保卫北境
All I wanted was to protect the North.

364
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:04,460
我带回了两支军队  两头巨龙
I brought two armies home with me, two dragons.

365
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:06,540
还有一个坦格利安女王
And a Targaryen queen.

366
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,020
你认为没有她  我们能打败死人军团吗
Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her?

367
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,150
我与他们交战过两次  珊莎
I fought them, Sansa. Twice.

368
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,120
你操心的是谁该封什么头衔
You want to worry about who holds what title,

369
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,160
我告诉你这不重要
I'm telling you it doesn't matter.

370
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:20,390
没有她  我们毫无胜算
Without her, we don't stand a chance.

371
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,410
你对我就没有一点信心吗
Do you have any faith in me at all?

372
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:34,840
我当然有
You know I do.

373
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,740
她会是一个好女王
She'll be a good queen.

374
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,100
我们所有人的女王
For all of us.

375
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,150
她和她父亲不一样
She's not her father.

376
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,440
是的  她漂亮多了
No, she's much prettier.

377
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,360
你俯首称臣是为了拯救北境
Did you bend the knee to save the North

378
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,220
还是因为你爱她
or because you love her?

379
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:33,970
你就是那个人吧
So you're the man?

380
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,990
我是哪个人  陛下
Which man am I, Your Grace?

381
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,890
救了乔拉爵士的人  在无人能救他的情况下
The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could.

382
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,560
不是不能  是不愿
They could, they just wouldn't.

383
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:48,710
等我夺回王位  学城也该更新一下气象
I'll have to make some changes in the Citadel when I take my throne.

384
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:51,320
立大功者需得重赏
A great service merits a great reward.

385
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:54,140
为您效劳是我的荣幸  陛下
Oh, it's my honor to serve you, Your Grace.

386
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,420
总有什么能让我赏你的吧
Well, there must be something I could give you.

387
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:00,270
若您不嫌麻烦
If it's not too much trouble,

388
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,840
请赦免我的罪过
I could use a pardon.

389
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,670
你犯了什么罪
For what crime?

390
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:09,360
我从学城借了几本书
I borrowed a few books from the Citadel.

391
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,330
还有一把剑
And also a sword.

392
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:16,070
-学城的剑吗  -是我家族的剑
- From the Citadel? - From my family.

393
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,740
在塔利家代代相传
It's been in House Tarly for generations.

394
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,780
论理以后是要归我的
It would've been mine anyway, eventually,

395
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,580
但我父亲另有打算
but my father had other ideas.

396
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,340
不会是蓝道·塔利吧
Not Randyll Tarly?

397
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,230
您认识家父
You know him?

398
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:39,260
我许诺准许他保留封地和头衔
I offered to let him retain his lands and titles

399
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,500
只要他俯首称臣
if he bent the knee.

400
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,650
但他拒绝了
He refused.

401
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,340
那么
Well...

402
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,590
既然我弟弟做了领主
At least I'll be allowed home again,

403
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:01,630
至少我可以回家了
now that my brother's the lord.

404
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,910
你弟弟与你父亲持同样立场
Your brother stood with your father.

405
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,570
谢谢您  陛下
Thank you, Your Grace.

406
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:28,100
谢谢您告诉我
For telling me.

407
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:29,420
我...
And m--

408
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,090
-我可以...  -当然
- May I...? - Of course.

409
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,800
你在外面做什么
What are you doing out here?

410
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:20,670
等一位老友
Waiting, for an old friend.

411
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,560
是时候告诉琼恩真相了
It's time to tell Jon the truth.

412
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:26,630
不  不
No, no.

413
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,600
你是他弟弟  不该由你告诉他吗
You're his brother. Shouldn't you tell him?

414
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:32,870
我不是他弟弟
I'm not his brother.

415
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:35,780
他最信赖的人是你
He trusts you more than anyone.

416
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:38,380
现在时机到了
Now's the time.

417
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,180
山姆
Sam?

418
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:18,940
抱歉  我知道我不该来这里
I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to be down here.

419
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,320
-你是在躲我吗  -当然不是
- Were you hiding from me? - Of course not.

420
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,930
你来临冬城做什么
What are you doing in Winterfell?

421
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:31,010
难道你已经读完学城所有的书了
Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?

422
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,570
出什么事了
What's wrong?

423
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,140
是吉莉吗  她还好吗
Gilly? Is she all right?

424
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,040
-她很好  -是小山姆吗
- She's good. - Little Sam?

425
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:42,900
你不知道吗
Don't you know?

426
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,340
知道什么
Know what?

427
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:47,890
丹妮莉丝
Daenerys...

428
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:51,140
她处死了我父亲和弟弟
she executed my father and brother.

429
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,530
他们是她的俘虏

430
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,110
她没告诉你
She didn't tell you.

431
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:09,420
我很遗憾
I'm so sorry.

432
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:14,670
我们得结束这场战争
We need to end this war.

433
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,610
换了你会那样做吗
Would you have done it?

434
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,250
我处死过不服从命令的人
Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me.

435
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,940
你也饶恕过
You've also spared men.

436
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:26,890
成千上万拒绝下跪的野人
Thousands of wildlings when they refused to kneel.

437
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,000
那时我不是王
I wasn't a king.

438
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:31,480
你是
But you were.

439
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:34,620
你一直都是

我放弃了王位  山姆

442
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:41,900
我不再是北境之王
I'm not King in the North anymore.

443
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:43,390
我说的不是北境之王
I'm not talking about the King in the North.

444
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:45,880
我说的是该死的七国之王
I'm talking about the King of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.

445
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,820
布兰和我发现了
Bran and I worked it out.

446
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:58,330
我找到总主教的日记  布兰...
I had a High Septon's diary. Bran had...

447
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:01,370
不管布兰怎么知道的
whatever Bran has.

448
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:02,750
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

449
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,560
你母亲

00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:17,940
是雷加·坦格利安
was Rhaegar Targaryen.

454
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,830
你从来都不是私生子
You've never been a bastard.

455
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,290
你是伊耿·坦格利安  铁王座真正的继承人
You're Aegon Targaryen, true heir to the Iron Throne.

456
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,450
我很遗憾  我知道你一时很难接受
I'm sorry, I know it's a lot to take in.

457
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:46,650
我父亲是我认识的最讲荣誉的人
My father was the most honorable man I ever met.

458
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:52,110
你的意思是他骗了我一辈子
You're saying he lied to me all my life.

459
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:53,210
不
No.

460
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,810
你父亲  好吧  奈德·史塔克

461
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,980
他对你母亲发誓永远保护你
He promised your mother he'd always protect you.

462
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:03,820
他做到了  劳勃要是知道了就会杀了你
And he did. Robert would have murdered you if he knew.

463
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:07,200
你是名正言顺的国王

464
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,530
伊耿·坦格利安六世

00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,410
-丹妮莉丝是我们的女王  -她不该是女王
- Daenerys is our queen. - She shouldn't be.

467
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,990
-这是叛国  -这是事实

468

你为了拯救百姓放弃王位
You gave up your crown to save your people.

469
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,130
她愿意做出同样的选择吗
Would she do the same?

470
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,490
退后  他有蓝眼睛

夜王留下来的
From the Night King.

476
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:47,760
他的大军在我们和临冬城之间  我们没有马
His army's between us and Winterfell. We're on foot.

477
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:49,770
我们是从黑城堡骑马来的
We rode down from Castle Black.

478
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,630
我们可以快马加鞭
We can double up on the horses.

479
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:55,530
只要马不跑死  我们能抢在死人前面
If the horses last, we'll get there before the dead.

480
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:58,520
我们只能指望先到的不是夜王了
We just have to hope the Night King doesn't come first.

481
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:52,880
继续  直走
Keep moving! Straight up!

482

跟紧了  别掉队
